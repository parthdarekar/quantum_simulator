# quantum_simulator
This repository contains code for a basic quantum simulator, as part of the screening task 3 for the qosf mentorship program.
For an introduction to the simulator, go to qosf_task_3.ipynb

Future improvements planned for the simulator:
1. Support for additional gates like parametric gates
2. Support for arbitrary application of controlled gates
3. Ability to implement quantum algorithms
4. Better user interface
